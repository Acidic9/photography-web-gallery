		Along with digitally editing images, photography is a skill all website developers should have up their sleeve. It will give them an edge over other web developers and can save time and money for both the developer and the client.
		<br><br>
		There are several digital photographic techniques used in the gallery on this website and all the photographs were edited in Adobe Photoshop. The images were cropped and resized and they all had their levels slightly modified amongst other edit. Editing an image's levels gives the ability to adjust brightness, contrast, and tonal range. Along with level adjustments and cropping, there have been edits such as colour adjustments, vignettes added, image sharpens, removing &amp; covering unwanted sections of the images as well as the obvious watermark shown in the bottom right corner of each image.
		<br><br>
		Apart from the few taken at home or by the beach, most of these photographs were taken in Adelaide City. These photographs may be sold if someone wanted to use them for their own purposes.

		Photographs show a lot of information and can be used to communicate with viewers. It is important as a photographer that you have a good understanding of how it's best to communicate through photography. The most common technique to communicate with photographs is to use the rule of thirds with your photography. Taking photos with the subject in the center of the photograph is perfectly fine but the rule of thirds contains 4 points where you should position the photograph's subject and in many famous photographs you can see this technique being used. Keeping space around the subject will allow you to digitally crop the photograph to position the subject in the rule of thirds.

		There are a few work health and safety requirements to comply with when using a camera and computer. Extensive use of a digital camera does not show to be too much a threat to the photographer when used correctly. Used batteries from a camera must be stored, handled and transported in accordance with the hazardous waste and dangerous goods legislation. Extensive use of a computer, including a keyboard and mouse, may cause injuries such Occupational Overuse Syndrome which is a condition that can be caused by a mixture of poor ergonomics, repetitive motion, stress and poor posture. Always be cautious of your posture when using a computer. Read more about this at <a href="http://workplaceohs.com.au/hazards/office-safety/computers">workplaceohs.com.au</a>.
